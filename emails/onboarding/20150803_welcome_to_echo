## About EChO

EChO is a student-run organization that provides unique chamber opportunities for students of all majors and instruments. We have a full orchestra (55 members last semester!) and small ensembles (36 last semester!) of 2-5 musicians. Our mission is to create a community of musicians within the Austin area and spread the appreciation of all forms music.

We have 2 concert series per year, one in December and one in May. Other performance opportunities include concerts at nursing homes, gigs at formal events, street performing at bake sales, and much more:

In addition to the musical aspects, we want our members get to know each other and have fun! I won't bore you with everything we've done, but see for yourself:
