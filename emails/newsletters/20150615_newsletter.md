### Farewell Note from Your Outgoing President, Khang Huynh
To my fellow friends of the esteemed Engineering Chamber Orchestra,
 
For the past four years, there has been no other organization for which I have sacrificed so much time and energy as Engineering Chamber Orchestra. Many of my fondest memories in my undergraduate years have been made with EChO as my accomplice. I have made so many great friends, discovered new music, and explored Austin’s finest treasures. And now to callously rip from my embrace my greatest love my life is such a cruel sin. Alas, I only have my heart and my thoughts to sustain me. But what an adventure it has been!
 
With anything that one feels passionately about, there persists an inexplicable desire to improve, excel, and exceed one’s expectations. One year ago, I outlined the main theme of my presidency. EChO suffered from a lack of camaraderie that is so integral to music making. Because of the inherently fragmented nature of our organization, it was difficult to convince our members to participate in events. To change this attitude, we did some revolutionary, radical things. We became more adventurous, sailing the treacherous waves of Lady Bird Lake, sampling the cuisines of some of Austin’s fine culinary outlets, and even playing some sports. I also heard about these shenanigans called “rehearsals” that you young uns were hosting for the first time as well. Hmm…
 
I also devoted a lot of attention to the orchestra. After all, over one-third of our members are now actively involved in this famed program. Logistically, we had a lot of success with this program: membership more than quadrupled in size since the spring of 2014; we performed in Bates Recital Hall for the first time; we performed very difficult repertoire and collaborated with musicians the Butler School of Music; we have even garnered attention and praise from higher-ups like Gerhardt Zimmermann, Director of Orchestral Activities at UT and Conductor of the Canton Symphony Orchestra; several conducting students; and the President of Virtuosi of Houston. But there is one thing that happened this year that matters infinitely more than any inconsequential statistics and trivia. This year, EChO truly developed into a community of bright and intelligent scholars from all across the University who share a passion for music. Some of my proudest moments have come to me when friends mention to me that they feel at home with EChO.
 
I’m not sure how exactly we accomplished this, but everyone participated in activities with a lot more vigor and enthusiasm than what I remembered from previous years. Something changed that galvanized an entire cultural and attitudinal shift in our organization. Regardless of how it happened, I hope that we maintain and bolster that momentum, that energy. No matter how the little sapling has grown this year, we have planted the seeds for great success. As EChO grows in repute, I hope the community that we have helped to build this year will continue to blossom.
 
I hope that I am able to stay in touch with all of you. If you ever have a burning desire to ask me anything or just want to chat, you can always reach me at khang.huynh@utexas.edu. I am also on this thing that you young undergrads are using nowadays. I think it’s called Facebook. (https://www.facebook.com/khang.huynh.372)
 
Thank you to all of you for such an amazing four years. I have the utmost respect and admiration for all of you, especially to those of you who have shed blood and tears behind the scenes. Best wishes to all of you, whether you are continuing your studies at UT, or plan to search for new meanings in your life elsewhere. I hope we are able to share in the delights of company and music soon.
 
With lots of love and hugs,
Khang
