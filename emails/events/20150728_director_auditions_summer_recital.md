## Intro
Hi everyone,

I hope your summer has been going well! We have two events coming up, Orchestra Director Auditions and the Summer Recital.

## Orchestra Director Auditions
This summer, EChO is holding its ever first Orchestra Director auditions, in which the candidates will hold a one-hour rehearsal with a small ensemble. This week we will be auditioning our 3rd and 4th candidates, Damian Berdakin and William Stagner.

We would like to invite you to attend these auditions:

### Audition for Damian Berdakin

- Date: Thursday, July 30th
- Time: 6:00 - 7:00 pm
- Location: MRH 5.138

### Audition for William Stagner

EChO will be hosting its first ever Summer Recital! Anyone in the UT community (students, staff, faculty, alumni) is welcome to participate. This event will be in a much more casual atmosphere than our semester concerts, with drinks and hors d'oeuvres to go around as our talented musicians perform.
 
Date: Saturday, August 8th
Time: 6:00 PM
Location: Formal Lounge, San Jacinto Hall (SJH 1245)
 
If you would like to perform a solo or ensemble piece, please email Khang at khang.huynh@utexas.edu.
