# 20150621 Summer Recital

Hi everyone!
 
 EChO will be hosting its first ever Summer Recital this August! Anyone in the UT community (students, staff, faculty, alumni) is welcome to participate. This event will be in a much more casual atmosphere than our semester concerts, with drinks and hors d'oeuvres to go around as our talented musicians perform.

EChO Inaugural Summer Recital
Date/Time: Weekend of August 7-9 (exact date and time TBD)
Location: likely one of the dorm lounges (feel free to suggest a location)
 
Everyone can perform one solo and one ensemble work (if so many people sign up, we may limit each person to one piece). Unlike during the academic year, EChO will not group ensembles together or assign music, but feel free to talk to an officer for help or suggestions.
 
To sign up, please fill out this form by Monday, June 29, 2015. If you are unsure whether you will be able to perform, fill out the form anyways. You can always cancel your performance at a later date.

If you have any questions, please email Khang at khang.huynh@utexas.edu.
