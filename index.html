<p>This is where I will be documenting my journey to transform the structure of the Engineering Chamber Orchestra, a student organization at UT, to be sustainable in the long run.</p>

<p>Why is this important? Why am I even focusing my time on doing this when I spend the same amount of time to get to know the members, plan amazing events, and have a "successful" term as President.</p>

<p>Well, I want to share the ideas I have with my officers and any interested members and empower them to be self-reliant and realize that each one of them can make a difference in the org. Even though doing this will be a lot more work for me and result in a more uncertainty in the short term, I believe that working towards a change in the underlying org structure will benefit everyone in the long term.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-this-all-started" class="anchor" href="#how-this-all-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How This All Started</h2>

<p>In April 2015, I was "elected" President of the Engineering Chamber Orchestra, or, as we like to call it, EChO. I say "elected" because I won the election by default. Due to time constraints, my predecessor did not think that it was necessary for me to go through the election process at all.</p>

<p>At the time, I didn't complain because I had spent the last week stressing over what I would say during my speech, trying to consolidate a good vision for the org, and realizing all the insecurities I had about being a leader. It was during this last minute "thinking" session when I first dawned on me that the role of President would be completely different from the other two leadership positions I've had, even the Vice President one. I didn't think I wasn't good enough to take on this new role because I felt that I had to do everything.</p>

<p>As a result, the whole last month of the semester was spent frantically planning our big concert, transitioning officers, trying to run officer meetings, making nice gifts for graduating seniors, sending emails and organizing gigs on top of all the work and school projects that I had to finish up and finals to study for. For some reason, I didn't think I needed other people's help, even when they clearly expressed that they would help out with anything I needed. By the time finals week came around, I completely burned out, probably ruined my relationship, and had no motivation to do anything.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I started my internship towards the end of May and met a couple of amazing people who were able to get me back on my feet. It took around a month into this internship for me to realize that it was okay to ask for help, to make mistakes, and essentially not be a perfectionist.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was thinking the plan I had for EChO next year. I went through a couple of ideas, most of which centered around how to delegate and distribute work in different committees. Towards the end of June, I had my first officer meeting where I outlined the plan for the 9 of us to lead committees of dedicated members and rationale behind doing it this way. Everyone agreed, but we were all preoccupied with our own plans for the summer. I realized that I would have to do quite a bit of nudging to actually execute the plan, but I kept on procrastinating.</p>

<p>On August 1st, I decided that I needed to start focusing on EChO if I wanted to accomplish my goals in the next year. During a trip to an amazing gaming lounge, I started planning different ways to go about this. After just a few sticky notes worth of writing, I realized the problem was more difficult than I originally anticipated. I asked a friend who was there and had gone through the same sort of restructing a few times before. He advised me to start with having smaller groups within the officer team work on the same tasks together to train them to be self sufficient first. That way, I would have more help and support in tackling the same problem on a larger scale.
So, that's how this all got started. The plan will be broken up in two parts: discovering ideas and trying/evaluating these ideas.</p>
